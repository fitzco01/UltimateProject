Had to go in and reset the password for root connecting from localhost
	Will probably have to deal with special cases when a bunch of different
	people can write to the database
Created new root user and set password for them in the mysql shell
Created the database
Then stopped/started mysql to refresh everything

See bookmarked pages from Matt for walkthroughs/helpful stuff

Currently able to connect to database locally, but having issues with mysql sytax

Wanted to wait to mess with the database on the server, don't want to unintentionally break things since I wasn't around when we set that up. Should be able to walk through the same steps above (see bookmarks) and re-create users and passwords, just want to make sure we do it right any everyone can be on the same page with it. Might have to make a bunch of different users later on down the road so users can write to the database
